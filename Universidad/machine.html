                <h2>Introduction to Machine Learning</h2>
                <h3>Motivation</h3>
                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Regression: <br>
                            One example of regression is to obtain or determine how old an abalone is, one way to measure its 
                            age is counting the number of rings its has in its interior, but this is a time-consuming task, so we need 
                            another easy way to solve this problem, we can obtain other measurements more easily, like sex, diameter, height, 
                            etc. So, with all these measurements we are going to try to predict its age using a regression model taking into account 
                            these features.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Classificatin: <br>
                            One example of using machine learning is through classification, for example if we need to recognize postal code 
                            from scanned mail, we need to identify each number and make a secuence of them to build the postal code in a automated way, 
                            so the input of our model should be differents number images with differents handwritting.
                        </li>
                        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/Universidad/ML/1-2.PNG" />
                        <li>
                            Clustering: <br>
                            Another example of using machine learning is through clustering, it is used when the learning is in 
                            an unsupervised way, that means we are not giving the correct answer to the machine, instead the machine 
                            needs to organize and label the data by itself, this is a good way when we dont know the result at the begining 
                            of a certain problem. So for example we can predict wheter a geiser is going to erupt taking into account two measurements, 
                            in this case, time between eruptions, and duration of the previous eruption, we can see we have 2 differents clustering meaning there 
                            exists a kind of correlation. 
                        </li>

                <h3>Learning as optimization</h3>
                <p>When setting up a learning problem, we need to optimize a Loss function to minimize the error our model 
                  can do. So, we need to find those W values that make our loss function the minimum.
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/Universidad/ML/1-35.PNG" />
                <p>
                  There are differents methods to optimize this function, one of those methods is called Gradient Descent, we start 
                  assign randomly those W values and then we look for the derivatives of the function and know where the function has their 
                  minimum values. Stochastic gradient descent also exists.
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/Universidad/ML/1-36.PNG" />
                <h3>Patterns and Generalization</h3>
                <p>
                  A pattern, is basically something that repeats or follow some kind of direction, data regularities. We can also 
                  have some relationships between variables what is another kind of pattern, also we have redudancy what that means 
                  we have the same data on differents ways. <br>
                  When getting new data it is probably to apply them a distribuited function, could be normal distribution, or others. 
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/Universidad/ML/1-37.PNG" />
                <h2>Boolean Functions</h2>
                <p>
                  If we want to learn with a boolean function, we need to see all the functions combination it has, that is, for example 
                  we have 2 features, x1, x2 we got 4 combinations to this 2 features, since its 2 "bits", then we have 16 ways of getting those 
                  combinations and it is obtain by 2^(2^n) <br>
                  We need for this problem 4 samples to solve it and obtain a function that represents the model, then this kind of problem where the number 
                  of samples is important we can not generalize them, since we need to know all the outputs for every entry or sample we have. 
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/Universidad/ML/1-38.PNG" />
                <p>
                  In general, learning problems are ill-posed because we have more than one solution for the same particular problem. 
                  It is then necessary to make additional assumptions. We can not surely what data is going to be next, for example in a 
                  secuence like 2,4,8,16, maybe the next number should be 32, but there is no way to be completely sure about that, it could be 
                  31, or 33 or another different number. So we need to make some assumptions before make a pattern. Normally with n number we can 
                  make a interpolation generating a n-1 polinomial regression.
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/Universidad/ML/1-39.PNG" />
                <p>
                  So what is a good pattern?, is a good choice to use the simplest pattern we have without lossing accuracity with 
                  the data, a priori is not simple to get a good pattern that fits the data. So, there exist a criteria that is called 
                  Occam´s razor that says that the easiest explanation would be the more probably to occur.
                </p>

                <h2>How to measure the quality of a solution</h2>
                <p>
                  We know the loss function measures the error in the training, set but obtaining a loss function with 
                  0 error not always should be a good measurment, maybe it means we had overfit our model and have overtrained it. 
                  So in order to avoid this situation we need to measure error in both cases in training data set, and validation dataset 
                  and it could be a good choice to pick that model where the validation error is minimum. That means we are in a good 
                  position our model solves the problem in a very good way. 
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/Universidad/ML/1-42.PNG" />
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/Universidad/ML/1-43.PNG" />

                <p>
                  So we know a good estimation to pick a model is through the error of the validation set, that is called 
                  generalization error, and we can control it through differents ways, for example cross validation or Regularization.
                </p>
