                <h4>Introduction to Data Analysis with Python</h4>
                <p>
                    In this section our goal is to answer: "Can we stimate the price of a car based on its characteristics?", 
                    we are going to go through this question using differentes tools along the journey.
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/applied_ds_ibm/c1-m1-1.PNG" />
                <p>
                    The first question we should ask is, Why data Analysis?, with data Analysis	we can give value to our data, 
                    data itself does not mean information by its own, it is our job to discover those insights through the data 
                    is collected to us.
                </p>
                <h4>The problem</h4>
                <p>
                    Tom is a normal person that want to sell his car, his car is used, but he do not know how much does the car cost,
                    he wants to sell it at the maximum price but he also knows that price needs to be reasonable to someone wants to
                    buy it, so How can we help tom to determine the best price to his car?
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/applied_ds_ibm/c1-m1-2.PNG" />
                <p>
                    We need to understand what features or characteristics make a car valuable or what determine its price, we can also 
                    compare data which other selling cars or carÂ´s that were sold in the past. We have a lot of information to start dig around.
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/applied_ds_ibm/c1-m1-3.PNG" />
                <p>
                    The first thing we need to do is Understand our Data, what we got? which format it is?, what kind of information each row 
                    give us, trough this example we are going to work with a csv file, which is comma separated value, that means each row of 
                    the data is actually one record to be aware of. each columns give us some kind of information and we can relate with documentation 
                    a priori.
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/applied_ds_ibm/c1-m1-4.PNG" />
                <p>
                    We also notice column 26 is "Price" that is our actual target value, or label, this means, price is the value 
                    that we want to predict from the dataset, and the predictors should be all the others variables listed.
                </p>
                <h4>Importing and Exporting Data</h4>
                <p>
                  Importing is the process of loading data from different sources using Python. <br>
                  When we load new data into our enviroment we need to keep in mind two factors:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Format: Some common format are csv,json, xlslsx, hdf </li>
                    <li>Path File: Tell us where data is stored, it could be locally or on the internet</li>
                  </ul>
                  In Python the way to import these data is through Pandas using <i>read_csv</i>
                </p>

                 <p>
                   Our Data has no columns header, so we need to specify to our program that.

                <p>
                  It is recommend to check out the data to get familiar with, using <i>df</i> is not recommended because it use a lot of 
                  computing resources, instead we can use <i>df.head(n)</i> where n are n first rows of our dataset. Similarly, 
                  <i>df.tail(n)</i> retrieves us the n last rows of the dataset.
                </p>   
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/applied_ds_ibm/c1-m1-6.PNG" />
                <p>
                  It is too difficult to work without headers in our dataset, we can assign it then, we create an array within 
                  all the headers associated with the data and then we assign it using <i>df.columns = headers</i>
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/applied_ds_ibm/c1-m1-7.PNG" />
                <p>
                  After working with your dataset, maybe you want to save it locally in same format as you load it, you can do this 
                  using the method <i>df.to_csv(path)</i>
                </p>
                <div class="highlight" style="background: #f8f8f8"><pre style="line-height: 125%;"><span></span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">path</span> <span style="color: #666666">=</span> <span style="color: #BA2121">"C:\Windows\...\automobile.csv"</span>

                  <span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">df</span>.<span style="color: #0000FF; font-weight: bold">to_csv</span><span style="color: #666666">(</span><span style="color: #008000; font-weight: bold">path</span><span style="color: #666666">)</span>
                  </pre></div>
                <p>
                  You can load and save data in a variety of formats, so here are some examples of how to use it:    
                </p>

                <h4>Getting Started Analyzing Data</h4>
                <p>
                  Before any analysis you need to understand your data, what datatypes are in the data, how the data is distributed along the dataset, 
                  taking into account these things you maybe point out potential issues, which may need to be resolved later on.  <br>
                  Data has variety of types, the would object, strings, int, float, etc.
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/applied_ds_ibm/c1-m1-9.PNG" />
                <p>
                  In pandas, we use <i>df.types</i> to check datatypes of all columns, we need to make sure all columns datatypes make sense, 
                  and later on try to solve it, because some methods depends on the datatype they rely.
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/applied_ds_ibm/c1-m1-10.PNG" />
                <p>
                  The first Insight of our dataset maybe is <i>df.describe</i> which retrieve a statistical summary of each colum, telling us 
                  information like, mean, std, min_vale, max_value, etc.
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/applied_ds_ibm/c1-m1-11.PNG" />
                <p>
                  This <i>df.describe()</i> only works with numeric data, columns or features that are non-numeric will be skipped, 
                  but this is not a issue at all, if we want all the information including non-numeric data, we need to add a parameter 
                  inside our method, so if we type <i>df.describe(include="all")</i> we retrieve all the information both numeric and non-numeric.
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/applied_ds_ibm/c1-m1-12.PNG" />
                <p>
                  Another useful method is <i>df.info()</i> which retrieves concise summary of our dataset with the first and last 
                  30 rows of data.
                </p>
                <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/applied_ds_ibm/c1-m1-13.PNG" />
