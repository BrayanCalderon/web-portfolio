          <h2>Defining Data Science</h2>
          <h4>What is Data Science?</h4>

          <p>
            Data Science is a field of study where you use a lot of data and ask
            yourself a set of questions about that data, so you start making
            some hypoteshis and assumptions, then with a set of tools like
            models, algorithms you can start dig into your data verifying if
            your assumptions were correct or not.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are many paths to data science, since the term is some new,
            because it is started to be used on later 2010, before that people
            just call it statistics, we can start a data science carreer no
            matter what our technical background is or hard background we got in
            the past , everything is related with data. But the real thing is,
            what are you going to do with the data if you are curious and start
            questioning about the data you got, you are in the right way,
            because being in that position is where you start to know more your
            data and star sharpening your hard skills in data-science.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good advice to start with yout data-science career is to be
            curious, argumentative and judgemental. Also you must be able to
            tell a good story from your data, you need to tell everybody what
            you found, if you can not tell a story with your data, all the
            discoverys you can have made, it will be buried, no one will know
            everything you found ant that is a sad ending.
          </p>
          <h4>What is the cloud?</h4>
          <p>
            Cloud is a godsend tool to data-scientis because we are allowued to
            do more stuff with the data, not only for our purposes but for
            sharing that data with a lot of people of differents places in th
            world we can work on the same data without being in the same place
            or even in the same computer or machine. Also with cloud we are able
            to deploy some algorithms and models with large datasets that in
            other cases we can not even start because of terms in speed,
            storage, etc. So cloud is a very good tool for us in those aspects.
          </p>

          <h2>What do data science people do?</h2>
          <h4>A day in the life of a data science person</h4>

          <p>
            We can start analyzing our data and be sure that our dataset is
            complete and maybe we can not find our solution in our data, but not
            always the solution would be in front of our eyes, maybe we need to
            watch other sides and think out of the box to try to improve our
            assumptions and then make new hypoteshis and models that try to
            solve our problem.
          </p>
          <h4>Data Science tools and technology</h4>
          <p>
            As data scientist we got a lot of tools we can use to analyze our
            data, some of them are more fancy than others, some of them help in
            a better way thant others, but at the end of the day, they are just
            tool, you are the master, you are the person who choose which tools
            is the best for each situations, and we have a lot of tools, for
            example, Linear Regression, polynomial regression, data
            visualization, machine learning algorithms, aritificial neural
            network, k-nearest neighbor, etc.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Data Science in Bussines</h2>
          <h4>How should companies get started in Data Science</h4>
          <p>
            I think the most importat thing when a company start to solve a
            problem with data science are the data, the data is the most
            important thing before any algorithm or data science approach,
            without data and data collected in a meaningful way we can not do
            much, because it exist a say thay says, Garbage In Garbage Out, if
            the data the company collected is not the best or bias, the analysis
            we can make with that data is going to be also byas because we try
            to build a model with the data.
          </p>
          <h4>Recruiting for data science</h4>
          <p>
            When companies start to recruiting employees as Data-Scientist they
            are focused more on the soft-skills than the hard-skills because
            hard-skills could be teached and learn by the participant, but soft
            skills like curiosity, sense of humour, storytelling are things you
            can not teach them, because that are inner qualities each person
            have, so in finally a company is hiring people that have social
            skills develop in a way they can relate something more than techinal
            things with the data they gave them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ultimate purpose of analytics is to communicate findings to the
            concerned who might use these insights to formulate policy or
            strategy.The data scientist should then use the insights to build
            the narrative to communicate the findings.
          </p>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Use Cases for Data Science</h2>
          <h4>Applications of Data Science</h4>

          <p>
            Data Science has applications nearly in avery aspect of the life
            that is because we can collect data for any aspect we can think, but
            there are some technologies that are new which are driving data
            science to new horizons, that is the case for augmented reality,
            medical health, retail, finance and other fields where the need to
            be the best brings with it the ability to keep getting better and
            better over the time. But we need to be aware of our models, no
            matter what or how accurate our model is we can not rely 100% in
            those models, we oftenly have false positives, cases where the
            prediction does not work at all. An we need to be also aware of that
            because at the same time we do thinkgs correct, there going to be
            cases when things does not work, and thatÂ´s ok, because models are
            not predicting the future, we are trying to insight what is more
            probable in the future based on past data.

        <div class="card">
          <h2>Final Reading First Course</h2>
          <h4>Establishing Data Mining Goals</h4>
          <p>
            The first step in data mining is to set up goals for the exercise. We must 
            identify the key question that need to be answered. Also
            we need to determine the level of accuracy and usefulness of the results 
            obtained from data mining. 
          </p>
          <h4>Selecting Data</h4>
          <p>
            The ouput of a data mining largely depends upon the quality of data 
            being used.At times data are ready availabe for further processing.
            On the other hand, data may not be readily available for data mining
            . In such cases you must identify other resources of data or even plan 
            new data collection initiatives. Therefore, identifying the right kind 
            of data needed for data mining that could answer the question 
            at reasonable costs is critical.
          </p>
          <h4>Preprocessing Data</h4>
          <p>
            Often raw data are messy, containing erroneous or irrelevant data.
            In addition, even with relevant data, information is sometimes missing. In
            the preprocessing stage, you identify the irrelevant attributes of data and expunge 
            such attributes from further considerations. At the same time
             identifying the erroneuos aspects of the data and flagging them as 
             such is necessary. Lastly, you must develop a formal method
              of dealing with missing data and determine wheter the data are missing
               randomly and systematically.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the data were missing randomly, a simple set of solutions would suffice. However
            , when data are missing in a systematic way, you must determine the impact of
            missig data on the results.
          </p>
          <h4>Transforming Data</h4>
          <p>
            The next step, is to determine the appropiate format in which data must be stored.
            An important consideration in data mining is to reduce the number of attributes needed to 
            explain the phenomena. This may require transforming data. Data reduction algorithms, 
            such as <i> Principal component Analysis</i>, can reduce the number of attributes without 
            a significant loss in information. In addition, variables may need to be transformed 
            to help explain the phenomenon being studied.  
          </p>
          <p>
            Often you need to transform variables from one type to another. It may be prudent to transform 
            the continous variable for income into a categorial variable were each record in the database 
            is identified as low,medium and high-income individual. This could help capture the non-linearities in 
            the underlying behaviours.
          </p>
          <h4>Storing Data</h4>
          <p>
            The transformed data must be stored in a format that makes it conducive for data mining. The data must 
            be stored in a format that gives unrestricted and immediate read/write privileges to the data scientist. During 
            data mining, new variables are created, which are written back to the original database, which is why the data storage 
            scheme should facilitate efficiently reading from writting to the database. It is also important to store data 
            on server or storage media that keeps the data secure and also prevents the data mining algorithm from unnecesarily 
            searching for pieces of data scattere on different server or storage media. Data safety and privacy should be a prime concern for storing data.
          </p>
          <h4>Mining Data </h4>
          <p>
            After data is appropriately processed, tranformed and stored, it is subject to data mining. This step 
            covers data analysis methods, including parametric and non-parametric methods, and machine-learning algorithms.
            A good starting for data mining is data visualization. Multidimensional views of the data using the advanced graphing
            capabilities of data mining softwares are very helpful in developing a preliminary understanding of the trends 
            hidden in the data set.
        
          </p>
          <h4>Evualating Minin Results</h4>
          <p>
            After results have been extracted from data mining, you do a formal evaluation of the results.
            Formal evaluation could include testing the predictive capabilities of the models on observed data to see 
            how effective and efficient and algorithm have been reproducing data. This is known as <i> in-sample forecast</i> 
            In Addition, the results are shared with the key stakeholders for feedback, which is then incorporated in the later iterations of data 
            mining to improve the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data mining and evaluatin the results become an iterative process such that the analyst use better and 
            improve algorithms to improve the quality of results generated in light of the feedback received from the stakeholders.

          <h2>From problem to approach</h2>
          <h4>Bussines Understanding</h4>
          <p>
            When we face a problem we need to start understading the bussines problem, asking ourself questions like "What is the problem that you are trying to solve" 
            and "How can you use data to answer the question?"
          </p>
          <h4>Case Study</h4>
          <p>
            <li>What is the best way to allocate the limited healthcare budget to maximize its use in providing quality care?</li> <br>
            
            Before even to collect data, the goal and objectives needed to be defined.
            
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li> <i>Goal:</i> To provide quality care without increasing costs</li>
            <li> <i>Objective:</i> To review the process to identify inefficiencies</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            After spending time on the things defined above, ibm team prioritized "patient readmissions" as an effective area of review.
          </p>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m1-readmission.PNG" />
          <p>
            After reviewing some records, it was discovered that the patients with congestive heart failure were are top of the 
            readmission list.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally four bussines requirements were identified for whatever model would be built.
            <ul>
              <li>Predict CHF readmission outcome(Y or N) for each patient.</li>
              <li>Predict the readmission risk for each patient</li>
              <li>Understand explicitly what combination of events led to the predicted outcome for each patient</li>
              <li>Easy to understand and apply to new patients to predict their readmission risk</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <h4>Analytic Approach</h4>
          <p>
            Once we have defined our bussines requirements, we face the a lot of tools to use, so we can select our analytic approach 
            based on type of questions as below:
          </p>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m1-analyticpick.PNG" />
          <p>
            Also there are types of questions that could drive our analytical approach for example if we are facing a problem where we need 
            to determine probabilities we can use a predictive model, to observer relationship a descriptive model, yes/no questions a classification model.
            
          </p>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m1-typequestion.PNG" />
          <p>
            Machine learning will be used to identify relationship and trends in data that might be non identify easily.
          </p>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c1-m1-ml.PNG" />
          <h4>Case Study</h4>
          <p>
            For this problem, IBM group choose a tree classification model to identify combination of conditions leading to each patientÂ´s outcome 
            From this information the analyst can obtain the readmission risk, or the likelihood of a yes for each patient.
          </p>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m1-tree.PNG" />

        </div>

        <div class="card">
          <h2>From Requeriments to Collection</h2>
          <h4>Data Requirements</h4>
          <p>
            Thinks of this section as data science methodology as cooking with data. Each step is critical in making the meal. <br>
            Data Scientist needs to identify: which ingredients are required, how to source and collect them, how to understand or work 
            with them, and how to prepare the data to meet the desired outcome. 
          </p>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m2-1.PNG" />
          <h4>Case Study</h4>
          <p>
            Working on the same case study we follow the next step, data requirements, since we are working with a tree classifier model,
            we need to prepare our data in advance to fullfill this model, so the first step is to select the cohort or the group that is to be studied.
            That cohort needs to be representative to the problem, including all the aspects talked in the problem definition, for this case our cohort is based on the next qualities.

          </p>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m2-2.PNG" />
          <p>
            Once we have select our cohort, we start defining the characteristics or the data relevant to each row or record, in this case, we need all the information 
            relevant to the patient during this CHF diagnosis.
          </p>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m2-3.PNG" />
          <h4>Data Collection</h4>
          <p>
            Once an initial data collection is made, a followed stage made by a data scientist is to get a first insight of the data collected,
            looking if the data is worthy to the problem or if we need more data in other aspect to completely fullfill the model.
          </p>
          <h4>Case Study</h4>
          <p>
            In our case study, we need to define where we are going to collect our data, we can obtain data from different sources, for example,
             Corporate data warehouse, record system, claim payment system, etc. Of course there will be data that we wanted but is not available, in this 
             case the best option is try to estimate the impact on the results, and then try to substitute in some way or discard it.
          </p>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m2-4.PNG" />
          <p>
            Other important step in data collection is "mergin data", it common to obtain data redundant that makes heavier our model, algorithms and databases, 
            so we need to work within other teams trying to eliminate this redundant data and get the best database or data possible of our problem.
          </p>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m2-5.PNG" />
       </div>

       <div class="card">
        <h2>From Understanding to Preparation </h2>
        <h4>Data Understanding </h4>
        <p>
          Data Understanding encompasses all activities related to constructing the data set. Essentially, the data understanding 
          section of the data science methodology answers the question: Is the data that you collected representative of the problem to be solved?
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-1.PNG" />
        <h4>Case Study</h4>
        <p>
          In our case study, we begin to doing some statistics to review our data, univariable statistics from the variables that we 
          are going to use in our model, such as mean, meadian, min, max, standard deviation, second pairwise correlation were used, 
          to see how closely certain variables were related, and which ones, if any, were very highly correlated, meaning that they 
          would be Essentially redundant, thus making one only relevant for modeling. <br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-2.PNG" />
          Third, histograms of the variables were examined to understand their distribution. Histograms are a good way to understand how 
          values or a variable are distributed, and which sort of data preparation would be needed to make the variables  more useful in a model.
          <br>
          For example, for a categorical variable that has too many distinct values to be informative in a model, the histogram would help them decide 
          how to consolidate those values. The univariates, statistics, and histograms are also used to asess data quality.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-3.PNG" />
        <p>
          Finally, this process is iterative, more we work with the data and more we learned we could redefine and refine our data collection to get more 
          meaningful data to our model.

        <h4>Data Preparation -  Concepts</h4>
        <p>
          <li>Cleaning data</li> <br>
          Is one of the more time consuming stages in a data science project.
          <li>Transforming Data</li> <br>
          Is the process of getting the data into a state where it may be easier to work with. The data preparation stage of methodology 
          answers the question: What are the ways in which data is prepared?. To work with the data, it must be prepared in a way that adresses 
          missing or invalid valued and removes duplicates, towards ensuring that everything is properly formatted. <br>

        <h4>Data Preparation - Case Study</h4>
        <p>
          First, the set of diagnosis related group codes 
          needed to be identified, as congestive heart 
          failure implies certain kinds of fluid buildups.
          We also needed to consider that congestive heart 
          failure is only one type of heart failure. <br>
          Clinical guidance was needed to get the right codes 
          for congestive heart failure. <br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-5.PNG" />
          The next step involved defining the re-admission criteria 
          for the same condition. The timing of events needed to 
          be evaluated in order to define wether a particular 
          congestive heart failure admission was an initial 
          event, which is called an index admission, or a 
          congestive heart failure-related readmission. <br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-6.PNG" />
          Based on clinical expertise, a time period of 30 days
           was set as the window for readmission relevant for 
           congestive heart failure patients, following the 
           discharge from the initial admission. <br>
           Next, the records that were in transactional format 
           were aggregated, meaning that the data included 
           multiple records for each patient. Transactional records 
           included professional provider facility claims submitted 
           for physicians, laboratory, hospital, and clinical 
           services. Also included were records describing all the 
           diagnoses, procedures, prescriptions and other information 
           about in-patients and out-patients. <br>
           <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-7.PNG" />
           A given patient could easily have hundreds or even thousand 
           of these records, depending on their clinical history. Then 
          , all the transactional records were aggregated to 
          the patient level, yielding a single record for each 
          patient, as required for the decision tree classification 
          method that would be used for modeling. <br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-8.PNG" />
          As part of the aggregation process, many new columns were 
          created representing the information in the transactions. 
          For example, frecuency and most recent visits to doctors, 
          clinics and hospitals with diagnoses, procedures prescriptions 
          and so forth. <br>
          Co-morbidities with congestive heart failure were also considered,
           such as diabetis, hypertension and many other diseases 
           and chronic conditions that could impact the risk of 
           re-admission for congestive heart failure. <br>
           <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-9.PNG" />
           During discussions around data preparation, a literature 
           review on congestive heart failure was also undertaken 
           to see wheter any important elements were overlooked,
            such as co-morbidities that had not yet been accounted 
            for. <br>
            The literature review involved looping back to the data 
            collection stage to add a few more indicators for procedures 
            and conditions. <br>
            <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-10.PNG" />
            Aggregating the transactional data at the patient level, 
            meant merging it with the other patient data, including 
            their demographic information, such as age, gender, type 
            of insurance, and so forth. <br>
            The results was the creation of one table containing a single 
            record per patient, with many columns representing the 
            attributes about the patient in his or her clinical history.<br>
            <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-11.PNG" />
            These columns would be used as variables in the predictive 
            modeling. Here is a list of variables that were ultimately 
            used in building the model. <br>
            <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-12.PNG" />
            The dependent variable, or target, was congestive heart 
            failure readmission within 30 days following discharge 
            from a hospitalization for congestive heart failure, 
            with an outcome of either yes or no. <br>
            The data preparation stage resulted in a cohort of 2343 
            patients meeting all of the criteria for this case study. <br>
            The cohort was then split into training and testing sets 
            for building and validating the model, respectively
