        <h2>Defining Data Science</h2>
        <h4>What is Data Science?</h4>

        <p>
          Data Science is a field of study where you use a lot of data and ask
          yourself a set of questions about that data, so you start making
          some hypoteshis and assumptions, then with a set of tools like
          models, algorithms you can start dig into your data verifying if
          your assumptions were correct or not.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are many paths to data science, since the term is some new,
          because it is started to be used on later 2010, before that people
          just call it statistics, we can start a data science carreer no
          matter what our technical background is or hard background we got in
          the past , everything is related with data. But the real thing is,
          what are you going to do with the data if you are curious and start
          questioning about the data you got, you are in the right way,
          because being in that position is where you start to know more your
          data and star sharpening your hard skills in data-science.
        </p>
        <p>
          A good advice to start with yout data-science career is to be
          curious, argumentative and judgemental. Also you must be able to
          tell a good story from your data, you need to tell everybody what
          you found, if you can not tell a story with your data, all the
          discoverys you can have made, it will be buried, no one will know
          everything you found ant that is a sad ending.
        </p>
        <h4>What is the cloud?</h4>
        <p>
          Cloud is a godsend tool to data-scientis because we are allowued to
          do more stuff with the data, not only for our purposes but for
          sharing that data with a lot of people of differents places in th
          world we can work on the same data without being in the same place
          or even in the same computer or machine. Also with cloud we are able
          to deploy some algorithms and models with large datasets that in
          other cases we can not even start because of terms in speed,
          storage, etc. So cloud is a very good tool for us in those aspects.
        </p>

        <h2>What do data science people do?</h2>
        <h4>A day in the life of a data science person</h4>

        <p>
          We can start analyzing our data and be sure that our dataset is
          complete and maybe we can not find our solution in our data, but not
          always the solution would be in front of our eyes, maybe we need to
          watch other sides and think out of the box to try to improve our
          assumptions and then make new hypoteshis and models that try to
          solve our problem.
        </p>
        <h4>Data Science tools and technology</h4>
        <p>
          As data scientist we got a lot of tools we can use to analyze our
          data, some of them are more fancy than others, some of them help in
          a better way thant others, but at the end of the day, they are just
          tool, you are the master, you are the person who choose which tools
          is the best for each situations, and we have a lot of tools, for
          example, Linear Regression, polynomial regression, data
          visualization, machine learning algorithms, aritificial neural
          network, k-nearest neighbor, etc.

        <h2>Data Science in Bussines</h2>
        <h4>How should companies get started in Data Science</h4>
        <p>
          I think the most importat thing when a company start to solve a
          problem with data science are the data, the data is the most
          important thing before any algorithm or data science approach,
          without data and data collected in a meaningful way we can not do
          much, because it exist a say thay says, Garbage In Garbage Out, if
          the data the company collected is not the best or bias, the analysis
          we can make with that data is going to be also byas because we try
          to build a model with the data.
        </p>
        <h4>Recruiting for data science</h4>
        <p>
          When companies start to recruiting employees as Data-Scientist they
          are focused more on the soft-skills than the hard-skills because
          hard-skills could be teached and learn by the participant, but soft
          skills like curiosity, sense of humour, storytelling are things you
          can not teach them, because that are inner qualities each person
          have, so in finally a company is hiring people that have social
          skills develop in a way they can relate something more than techinal
          things with the data they gave them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The ultimate purpose of analytics is to communicate findings to the
          concerned who might use these insights to formulate policy or
          strategy.The data scientist should then use the insights to build
          the narrative to communicate the findings.
        </p>

        <h2>Use Cases for Data Science</h2>
        <h4>Applications of Data Science</h4>

        <p>
          Data Science has applications nearly in avery aspect of the life
          that is because we can collect data for any aspect we can think, but
          there are some technologies that are new which are driving data
          science to new horizons, that is the case for augmented reality,
          medical health, retail, finance and other fields where the need to
          be the best brings with it the ability to keep getting better and
          better over the time. But we need to be aware of our models, no
          matter what or how accurate our model is we can not rely 100% in
          those models, we oftenly have false positives, cases where the
          prediction does not work at all. An we need to be also aware of that
          because at the same time we do thinkgs correct, there going to be
          cases when things does not work, and thatÂ´s ok, because models are
          not predicting the future, we are trying to insight what is more
          probable in the future based on past data.

        <h2>Final Reading First Course</h2>
        <h4>Establishing Data Mining Goals</h4>
        <p>
          The first step in data mining is to set up goals for the exercise. We must
          identify the key question that need to be answered. Also
          we need to determine the level of accuracy and usefulness of the results
          obtained from data mining.
        </p>
        <h4>Selecting Data</h4>
        <p>
          The ouput of a data mining largely depends upon the quality of data
          being used.At times data are ready availabe for further processing.
          On the other hand, data may not be readily available for data mining
          . In such cases you must identify other resources of data or even plan
          new data collection initiatives. Therefore, identifying the right kind
          of data needed for data mining that could answer the question
          at reasonable costs is critical.
        </p>
        <h4>Preprocessing Data</h4>
        <p>
          Often raw data are messy, containing erroneous or irrelevant data.
          In addition, even with relevant data, information is sometimes missing. In
          the preprocessing stage, you identify the irrelevant attributes of data and expunge
          such attributes from further considerations. At the same time
          identifying the erroneuos aspects of the data and flagging them as
          such is necessary. Lastly, you must develop a formal method
          of dealing with missing data and determine wheter the data are missing
          randomly and systematically.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the data were missing randomly, a simple set of solutions would suffice. However
          , when data are missing in a systematic way, you must determine the impact of
          missig data on the results.
        </p>
        <h4>Transforming Data</h4>
        <p>
          The next step, is to determine the appropiate format in which data must be stored.
          An important consideration in data mining is to reduce the number of attributes needed to
          explain the phenomena. This may require transforming data. Data reduction algorithms,
          such as <i> Principal component Analysis</i>, can reduce the number of attributes without
          a significant loss in information. In addition, variables may need to be transformed
          to help explain the phenomenon being studied.
        </p>
        <p>
          Often you need to transform variables from one type to another. It may be prudent to transform
          the continous variable for income into a categorial variable were each record in the database
          is identified as low,medium and high-income individual. This could help capture the non-linearities in
          the underlying behaviours.
        </p>
        <h4>Storing Data</h4>
        <p>
          The transformed data must be stored in a format that makes it conducive for data mining. The data must
          be stored in a format that gives unrestricted and immediate read/write privileges to the data scientist.
          During
          data mining, new variables are created, which are written back to the original database, which is why the data
          storage
          scheme should facilitate efficiently reading from writting to the database. It is also important to store data
          on server or storage media that keeps the data secure and also prevents the data mining algorithm from
          unnecesarily
          searching for pieces of data scattere on different server or storage media. Data safety and privacy should be
          a prime concern for storing data.
        </p>
        <h4>Mining Data </h4>
        <p>
          After data is appropriately processed, tranformed and stored, it is subject to data mining. This step
          covers data analysis methods, including parametric and non-parametric methods, and machine-learning
          algorithms.
          A good starting for data mining is data visualization. Multidimensional views of the data using the advanced
          graphing
          capabilities of data mining softwares are very helpful in developing a preliminary understanding of the trends
          hidden in the data set.

        </p>
        <h4>Evualating Minin Results</h4>
        <p>
          After results have been extracted from data mining, you do a formal evaluation of the results.
          Formal evaluation could include testing the predictive capabilities of the models on observed data to see
          how effective and efficient and algorithm have been reproducing data. This is known as <i> in-sample
            forecast</i>
          In Addition, the results are shared with the key stakeholders for feedback, which is then incorporated in the
          later iterations of data
          mining to improve the process.
        </p>
        <p>
          Data mining and evaluatin the results become an iterative process such that the analyst use better and
          improve algorithms to improve the quality of results generated in light of the feedback received from the
          stakeholders.

        <h2>From problem to approach</h2>
        <h4>Bussines Understanding</h4>
        <p>
          When we face a problem we need to start understading the bussines problem, asking ourself questions like "What
          is the problem that you are trying to solve"
          and "How can you use data to answer the question?"
        </p>
        <h4>Case Study</h4>
        <p>
          <li>What is the best way to allocate the limited healthcare budget to maximize its use in providing quality
            care?</li> <br>

          Before even to collect data, the goal and objectives needed to be defined.

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <i>Goal:</i> To provide quality care without increasing costs</li>
          <li> <i>Objective:</i> To review the process to identify inefficiencies</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          After spending time on the things defined above, ibm team prioritized "patient readmissions" as an effective
          area of review.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m1-readmission.PNG" />
        <p>
          After reviewing some records, it was discovered that the patients with congestive heart failure were are top
          of the
          readmission list.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally four bussines requirements were identified for whatever model would be built.
        <ul>
          <li>Predict CHF readmission outcome(Y or N) for each patient.</li>
          <li>Predict the readmission risk for each patient</li>
          <li>Understand explicitly what combination of events led to the predicted outcome for each patient</li>
          <li>Easy to understand and apply to new patients to predict their readmission risk</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Analytic Approach</h4>
        <p>
          Once we have defined our bussines requirements, we face the a lot of tools to use, so we can select our
          analytic approach
          based on type of questions as below:
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m1-analyticpick.PNG" />
        <p>
          Also there are types of questions that could drive our analytical approach for example if we are facing a
          problem where we need
          to determine probabilities we can use a predictive model, to observer relationship a descriptive model, yes/no
          questions a classification model.

        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m1-typequestion.PNG" />
        <p>
          Machine learning will be used to identify relationship and trends in data that might be non identify easily.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c1-m1-ml.PNG" />
        <h4>Case Study</h4>
        <p>
          For this problem, IBM group choose a tree classification model to identify combination of conditions leading
          to each patientÂ´s outcome
          From this information the analyst can obtain the readmission risk, or the likelihood of a yes for each
          patient.

        <h2>From Requeriments to Collection</h2>
        <h4>Data Requirements</h4>
        <p>
          Thinks of this section as data science methodology as cooking with data. Each step is critical in making the
          meal. <br>
          Data Scientist needs to identify: which ingredients are required, how to source and collect them, how to
          understand or work
          with them, and how to prepare the data to meet the desired outcome.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m2-1.PNG" />
        <h4>Case Study</h4>
        <p>
          Working on the same case study we follow the next step, data requirements, since we are working with a tree
          classifier model,
          we need to prepare our data in advance to fullfill this model, so the first step is to select the cohort or
          the group that is to be studied.
          That cohort needs to be representative to the problem, including all the aspects talked in the problem
          definition, for this case our cohort is based on the next qualities.

        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m2-2.PNG" />
        <p>
          Once we have select our cohort, we start defining the characteristics or the data relevant to each row or
          record, in this case, we need all the information
          relevant to the patient during this CHF diagnosis.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m2-3.PNG" />
        <h4>Data Collection</h4>
        <p>
          Once an initial data collection is made, a followed stage made by a data scientist is to get a first insight
          of the data collected,
          looking if the data is worthy to the problem or if we need more data in other aspect to completely fullfill
          the model.
        </p>
        <h4>Case Study</h4>
        <p>
          In our case study, we need to define where we are going to collect our data, we can obtain data from different
          sources, for example,
          Corporate data warehouse, record system, claim payment system, etc. Of course there will be data that we
          wanted but is not available, in this
          case the best option is try to estimate the impact on the results, and then try to substitute in some way or
          discard it.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m2-4.PNG" />
        <p>
          Other important step in data collection is "mergin data", it common to obtain data redundant that makes
          heavier our model, algorithms and databases,
          so we need to work within other teams trying to eliminate this redundant data and get the best database or
          data possible of our problem.

        <h2>From Understanding to Preparation </h2>
        <h4>Data Understanding </h4>
        <p>
          Data Understanding encompasses all activities related to constructing the data set. Essentially, the data
          understanding
          section of the data science methodology answers the question: Is the data that you collected representative of
          the problem to be solved?
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-1.PNG" />
        <h4>Case Study</h4>
        <p>
          In our case study, we begin to doing some statistics to review our data, univariable statistics from the
          variables that we
          are going to use in our model, such as mean, meadian, min, max, standard deviation, second pairwise
          correlation were used,
          to see how closely certain variables were related, and which ones, if any, were very highly correlated,
          meaning that they
          would be Essentially redundant, thus making one only relevant for modeling. <br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-2.PNG" />
          Third, histograms of the variables were examined to understand their distribution. Histograms are a good way
          to understand how
          values or a variable are distributed, and which sort of data preparation would be needed to make the variables
          more useful in a model.
          <br>
          For example, for a categorical variable that has too many distinct values to be informative in a model, the
          histogram would help them decide
          how to consolidate those values. The univariates, statistics, and histograms are also used to asess data
          quality.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-3.PNG" />
        <p>
          Finally, this process is iterative, more we work with the data and more we learned we could redefine and
          refine our data collection to get more
          meaningful data to our model.
        </p>
        <h4>Data Preparation - Concepts</h4>
        <p>
          <li>Cleaning data</li> <br>
          Is one of the more time consuming stages in a data science project.
          <li>Transforming Data</li> <br>
          Is the process of getting the data into a state where it may be easier to work with. The data preparation
          stage of methodology
          answers the question: What are the ways in which data is prepared?. To work with the data, it must be prepared
          in a way that adresses
          missing or invalid valued and removes duplicates, towards ensuring that everything is properly formatted. <br>

        <h4>Data Preparation - Case Study</h4>
        <p>
          First, the set of diagnosis related group codes
          needed to be identified, as congestive heart
          failure implies certain kinds of fluid buildups.
          We also needed to consider that congestive heart
          failure is only one type of heart failure. <br>
          Clinical guidance was needed to get the right codes
          for congestive heart failure. <br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-5.PNG" />
          The next step involved defining the re-admission criteria
          for the same condition. The timing of events needed to
          be evaluated in order to define wether a particular
          congestive heart failure admission was an initial
          event, which is called an index admission, or a
          congestive heart failure-related readmission. <br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-6.PNG" />
          Based on clinical expertise, a time period of 30 days
          was set as the window for readmission relevant for
          congestive heart failure patients, following the
          discharge from the initial admission. <br>
          Next, the records that were in transactional format
          were aggregated, meaning that the data included
          multiple records for each patient. Transactional records
          included professional provider facility claims submitted
          for physicians, laboratory, hospital, and clinical
          services. Also included were records describing all the
          diagnoses, procedures, prescriptions and other information
          about in-patients and out-patients. <br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-7.PNG" />
          A given patient could easily have hundreds or even thousand
          of these records, depending on their clinical history. Then
          , all the transactional records were aggregated to
          the patient level, yielding a single record for each
          patient, as required for the decision tree classification
          method that would be used for modeling. <br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-8.PNG" />
          As part of the aggregation process, many new columns were
          created representing the information in the transactions.
          For example, frecuency and most recent visits to doctors,
          clinics and hospitals with diagnoses, procedures prescriptions
          and so forth. <br>
          Co-morbidities with congestive heart failure were also considered,
          such as diabetis, hypertension and many other diseases
          and chronic conditions that could impact the risk of
          re-admission for congestive heart failure. <br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-9.PNG" />
          During discussions around data preparation, a literature
          review on congestive heart failure was also undertaken
          to see wheter any important elements were overlooked,
          such as co-morbidities that had not yet been accounted
          for. <br>
          The literature review involved looping back to the data
          collection stage to add a few more indicators for procedures
          and conditions. <br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-10.PNG" />
          Aggregating the transactional data at the patient level,
          meant merging it with the other patient data, including
          their demographic information, such as age, gender, type
          of insurance, and so forth. <br>
          The results was the creation of one table containing a single
          record per patient, with many columns representing the
          attributes about the patient in his or her clinical history.<br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-11.PNG" />
          These columns would be used as variables in the predictive
          modeling. Here is a list of variables that were ultimately
          used in building the model. <br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m3-12.PNG" />
          The dependent variable, or target, was congestive heart
          failure readmission within 30 days following discharge
          from a hospitalization for congestive heart failure,
          with an outcome of either yes or no. <br>
          The data preparation stage resulted in a cohort of 2343
          patients meeting all of the criteria for this case study. <br>
          The cohort was then split into training and testing sets
          for building and validating the model, respectively

        <h2>From Modeling to Evaluation</h2>
        <h4>Modeling Concepts </h4>

        <p>
          Modelling is the stage in the data science methodology where the data scientist has the chance to sample the
          sauce
          and determine if itÂ´s bang on ir in need for more seasoning. This portion is geared to answer two questions:
          First:
          What is the purpose of data modelling, and second, what are some characteristics of this process?
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m4-1.PNG" />
        <p>
          Data modelling focuses on developing models that are either descriptive or predictive. An example of a
          descriptive model
          might examine things like: if a person did this, then they are likely to prefer that. A predictive model tries
          to yield
          yes/no, or stop/go type outcomes.These models are based on the analytic approach that was taken, either
          statically driven
          or machine learning driven.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m4-2.PNG" />
        <p>
          Data Scientist also split the data into two groups, the training set and the test set, the training set is
          used as its name says
          to train the model or differents algorithms and the test set determine how accurate or effective our algorithm
          is. We also need to be aware
          of overfitting our model or giving it few data that in uncapable to get the behaviour we need.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m4-3.PNG" />
        <p>
          The data compilation, preparation and modelling is succeded when we understand deeply three things, starting
          with understanding
          the question at hand, then selecting the correct analytic approach or method to solve the problem and finally
          obtain, understand, and model the data.

        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m4-4.PNG" />
        <p>
          After all the steps were done, we need to answers ourselves if we are good enough with our model, it
          corresponds to the reality?
          it is near and relevant to the cases we expect? we need to tweak it more to be more accurate? we need to
          collect more data for its corrects building?
          We hope all these questions were affirmatively correct and go through the next step.
        </p>

        <h4>Case Study</h4>
        <p>
          In our caste study in the congestive heart failure readmission, we are looking for patients with high-risk
          readmission,
          so the outcome of interest will be congestive heart failure equals "yes". In this first model, overall
          accuracy in clasifying
          the yes and no outcomes was 85%. This sounds good, but it represents only 45% of the "yes". The actual
          readmission are correctly
          classified, meaning that the model is not very accurate.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m4-5.PNG" />
        <p>
          The question then becomes: How could the accuracy of the model be improved in predecting the yes outcome?. For
          decision tree
          classification, the best parameter to adjust is the relative cost of missclasified yes or no outcomes. <br>
          When a true, non-readmission is missclasified, and action taken is to reduce that patientÂ´s risk, the cost of
          that error
          is the wasted intervention. A statistician call this a false-positive. But when a true readmission is
          missclasified, and no action
          is no taken to reduce that risk, than the cost of that error is the readmission and all its attended costs,
          plus the trauma to the patient, this
          is a false-negative . So we can see the cost of both missclassification errors can be quite different. For
          this reason, it is
          reasonable to adjust the relative weights of missclasifying the yes and no outcomes. The default is 1-1, but
          the decision tree algorithm,
          allows setting of a higher value for a yes. For the second model the relative cost was set at 9:1. <br>
          This is a very high ratio, but gives more insight to the modelÂ´s behaviour. This time the model correctly
          classified the 97%
          of the yes, but at the expense of a very low accuracy on the no, with an overall accuracy of only 49%. The
          problem with this
          outcome is the large number of false-positives, which would recommend unnecesary and costly intervention for
          patients, who
          would not have been re-admitted anyway. <br>
          Therefore, the data-scientist needs to try again to find a better balance between the yes and no accuracies.
          For the third model,
          the relative cost was set at a more reasonable 4-to-1. This time a 68% accuracy was obtained only in yes,
          called sensivity by statistician,
          and 85% accuracy on the no, called specificity, with an overall accuracy of 81%. This is the best balance that
          can be obtained with a
          rather small training set trough adjusting the relative cost of missclasified yes and no outcomes parameters.
          <br>
          A lot more work goes into the modeling, including iterating back to the data preparation stage to redefine
          some of other variables
          , so as to better represent the underlygin information, and thereby improve the model.

        </p>

        <h4>Evaluation</h4>
        <p>
          A model evaluation goes hand-in-hand with model building, such as the evalutaion and modeling stages are donde
          iteratively.
          Model evaluation is performed during model development and before the model is deployed. Evaluation allows the
          quality of the model
          to be assessed but it is also an opportunity to see if it meets the initial request. Evaluation answers the
          question: Does the Model
          used really answer the initial question or does it need to be adjusted? <br>
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m4-6.PNG" />

          Model evaluation can have two main phases: The first is the diagnostic measures phase, which is ensured the
          model is working as intended.
          If the model is a predictive model, a decision tree can be used to evaluate if the answers the model can
          ouput, is aligned to the initial design.
          It can be used to see where there are areas that require adjustments. If the model is a descriptive model, one
          in which relationships
          are being assessed, then a testing set with unknown outcomes can be applied, and the model can be refined as
          needed. <br>
          The second fase of the evaluation that may be used is statistical significance testing. This type of
          evaluation can be applied to the model
          to ensure that the data is being properly handle and interpreted within the model. This is designed to avoid
          unnecesary second
          guessing when the answer is revealed.

        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m4-7.PNG" />

        <h4>Case Study </h4>
        <p>
          One way to find the optimal model through a diagnostic measured based on tuning one of the parameters in model
          building.
          Specifically we will see how to tune the relative cost of missclasifying yes and no outcomes.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m4-8.PNG" />

        <p>
          As shown in the table 4 models were built, with diffferents relative cost to yes and no outcomes. As wee see
          each model
          increases the true-positive rate of the accuracy of predicting yes, at the expense of accuracy in predicting
          no, that is an
          increasing false-positive rate. The question to be made is: which of this model is the best based on tuning
          this parameter?.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m4-9.PNG" />
        <p>
          There is a curve called "ROC Curve" that is a diagnostic tool for classification model evaluation. So the
          optimal model is the
          one giving the maximum separation between the relative ROC curve relative to the red base line. We can see
          that model 3 with a
          relative cost at 4-to-1 is giving the maximum separation so this is the optimal model.

        <h2>From Deployment to Feedback</h2>
        <h4>Deployment</h4>
        <p>
          While a data science model will provide an answer, the key to making the answer relevant and useful involves
          getting the stakeholder
          familir with the tool produce.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m5-1.PNG" />
        <p>
          Once the model is evaluated and the data scientist is confident it will work, it is deployed and put to the
          ultimate test.
          Depending on the model it will be putted into a test scenario or public to people.
        </p>
        <h4>Case Study</h4>
        <p>
          The first step was to assimiliate the knowledge for the bussines group who would be designing and managing the
          invertion program
          to reduce readmission risk, in this scenario, the bussines people translated the model results so that the
          clinical staff could understand
          how to identify high-risk patient and design suitable intervention actions. The goal, of course, was to reduce
          the likelihoodt that
          these patients would be readmitted within a month after discharge.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m5-2.PNG" />
        <p>
          During the bussiness requirements stage, the intervention program director and her team had wanted an
          application that would
          provided automated, near real-time risk assesments of congestive heart failure, it also has to be easy to use
          by the clinical staff
          and preferably through browser-based application on a tablet. This patient data was generated througout the
          hospital stay. It would be
          prepared automatically prepared in a format needed by the model and each patient would be scored near the time
          of discharge. <br>
          Clinicians most have the most up-to-date risk assesments for each patient, helping them to select which
          patients to target for intervention
          after discharge.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m5-3.PNG" />
        <p>
          As part of solution of deployment, the intervention team would develop and deliver training for the clinical
          staff. Also
          processes and tracking and monitoring patients receiving the intervention would have to be develop in
          collaboration wit IT developers
          and database administrators so that results could go through the feedback stage and the model could be refine
          over time.

        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m5-4.PNG" />
        <p>
          One example of deployment application was the cognos application where shows state where diabetes has more
          risk in juveniles.

        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m5-5.PNG" />

        <h4>Feedback</h4>
        <p>
          Once in play, feedback from the users will help to refine the model and assess it for performance and impact.
          The value of the
          model will be dependent on succesfully incorporating feedback and making adjustments for long as the solutions
          requires.

        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c2-m5-6.PNG" />
        <p>
          Throghout the data science methodology, each step sets the stage for the next, making the methodoly cyclical,
          ensures
          refinement at each stage in the game. The feedback process is rooted in the notion that, the more you know,
          the more that you will
          want to know

        <h2>Language of Data Science</h2>
        <h4>Languages of Data Science</h4>
        <p>
          When starting on Data Science there are many languages to start with, selecting one of them depends on many
          aspects,
          what is the problem you are solving, how old is the application, base language for a company, etc. You dont
          need to master
          all of them, but knowing you can use them there would be easier to swap to another language if the case
          needed.
          <br>
          Python, R, and SQL maybe be the principals or the first progamming languages we must learn in our Data Science
          Journey, python
          because its facility in working with science applications and learning, R for statistics and, SQL for working
          with the data. Also
          there are other programming languages that we can use for data science, for example, Scala, Java, C++, Julia,
          JavaScript, php, Go, Ruby <br>
          There are many roles we can aspire in Data Science:
        <ul>
          <li>Busyness Analyst</li>
          <li>Database Engineer</li>
          <li>Data Analyst</li>
          <li>Data Engineer</li>
          <li>Data Scientist</li>
          <li>Research Scientist</li>
          <li>Software Engineer</li>
          <li>Statistician</li>
          <li>Product Manager</li>
          <li>Project Manager</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h4>Introduction to Python </h4>
        <p>
          Python is a powerhouse language, is by far the most popular language in data science, python is a good for
          those people
          whos already know how to programm, also for the new ones who want to learn because of the huge community and
          documentation available
          nearly 80% of data proffesiona used it. Python is also heavily used in Data Science, IA, and machine learning,
          web development,
          Internet of Things with devices like Raspberry Pi.
        </p>
        <p>
          Python is great to used because it is a general purpose language, so it has a huge amount of libraries to use
          with,
          we can use libraries to work with, databases, automation, web scrapping, text processing, image processing,
          machine learning
          and data analytics. <br>
          For Data Science we have come computing libraries like: Numpy, Pandas, SciPy, and MatplotLib. <br>
          For Artificial intelligence it has Pytorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-Learn <br>
          Python also can be used for Natural Language processing (NLP) using the Natural Language toolkit (NLTK)
        </p>

        <h4>Introduction to R</h4>
        <p>
          We start this introduction by saying R is a free software while Python is a open source project, they are
          similar but no equal.
          <br>

        <ul>

          Similiarties: <br><br>

          <li>Both commonly refers to the same set of licenses</li>
          <li>Both support collaboration </li>
          <li>In many cases these terms can be used interchangeably </li>
          <br>

          Differences:<br><br>
          <li>Open Source Iniative (OSI) champions open source while the Free Software Foundations (FSF) defines Free
            Software </li>
          <li>Open Source is more bussines focused while Free Software is more focused on a set of values </li>
          <br>
        </ul>
        R is most used by Statistician, mathematicians, and data miners for developing statistical software, graphing
        and data visualization.
        <br>
        The array-oriented syntax make it easier to translate from math to code. <br>
        Most folks learn R few years later started their jorney in Data Science, but they also says that R is a good
        starting programming
        language for data science with those who does not have programming background before. <br>
        R is mostly used in academia, but there are also some companies who work with R, include IBM, Facebook, Google,
        Microsoft, etc.
        <br>
        R is a great programming language becase it has the biggest statistical repository in the world, also R has over
        15000 publicly released
        packages to work with complex exploratory data analysis. <br>
        R integrates well with other programming languages like python, Java, .Net, C++, etc. And have some operations
        like matrix multiplications
        work out of the box. <br>
        Finally R has stronger object-oriented programming facilities than most statistical computing languages.
        </p>
        <h4>Introduction to SQL</h4>
        <p>
          SQL is a different programming language that Python and R and it is because is a non-procedural language. SQL
          means
          Structured Query Language an it is useful to handle structured data, data incorporating relations amongs
          entities and variables. <br>
          SQL was designed for mananing data in relational databses.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c3-m1-1.PNG" />
        <p>
          A relational database is formed by collections of two-dimensional tables;
          for example,datasets and Microsoft Excel Spreadsheets. <br>
          The SQL language is subdivided into several language elements, incluiding clauses, expressions,
          predicates, queries, and statements.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c3-m1-2.PNG" />
        <p>
          What makes SQL great is that it helps you to obtain
          jobs as business and data analyst and is a must in data
          engineering and data science. When performing operations
          with SQL the data is accessed directly (without any need to copy it
          beforehand). This cand considerably speed up workflow executions. <br>
          SQL is the interpreter between you and the database. <br>
          There are many SQL databases available, including MySQL, IBM Db2,
          PostgresSQL, Apache, SQlite and more. <br>

        </p>
        <h4>Other Languages</h4>
        <p>
          Languages like Scala, Java, C++ and Julia are the most popular after
          python, R and SQL. <br>
          Java is tried an true general purpose object oriented programming language.
          Huge adoption in the enterprise space, designed to be fast and scalable. <br>
          Scala is a general purpose programming language that provides supoprt for functional programming. <br>
          C++ is a general purpose language, improve processing speed, enables system programming, and
          gives you broader control over the application. <br>
          JavaScript core techonology for the world wide web. Is a a general purpose
          language that extended beyond the browser with Node.js and other server side approaches.
          Tensorflow is possible in Javascript. <br>
          Julia was designed at MIT for high-performance numerical
          analysis and computational science.
          Same speedy development like python or R while producing programs that runs
          as fast as C or Fortran programs would.
          Is a young language with a lot promise in Data Science future.

        <p>
          <li>Data Management</li>
          Is the process of persisting and retrieving data. The most widely used open source data management tools are
          relational
          databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL and noSQL databases like MongoDB, CouchDB, and Cassandra. File based tools
          such as the
          Hadoop File System or Cloud System like Ceph.
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c3-m2-2.PNG" />
          There are other data management tools in a commercial enviroment, tools like Oracle, IBM db2, and microsoft
          SQL server are example of them.

          <li>Data Integration and transformation</li>
          Referred to as Extract, transform, and load, or "ETL"
          is the process of retrieving data from remote data management
          systems. Transforming data and loading it into a local data
          management system is also part of Data Integration and transformation. Most widely used open source software
          used for data integration and transformation are: Apache Airflow, KubeFlow, which enables you to execute data
          science pipelines on top of kubernetes, Apache Kafka which is originated from Linkedin, Nifi, which delivers
          a very nice visual editor, SparkSQL which enables you to use ANSI SQL and scales up to computer clusters, and
          NodeRed, which
          also provides a visual editor.
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c3-m2-3.PNG" />

          <li>Model Building</li>
          Is the process of creating a machine learning or deep learning model using an appropiate
          algorithm with a lot of data.
          The most prominent of these types of products are: SPSS Modeler an SAS, also Watson Studio Desktop


          <li>Model Deployment</li>
          Makes such a machine learning or deep learning model available to third-party applications.Once you have
          created a
          machine learning model capable of predicting some key aspects of the future, you should make that model
          consumable by other
          developers and turn it into an API. <br>
          Apache Prediction IO, currently only supports Apache spark ML models for deployment,Seldon is an interesting
          product since it
          supports nearly every framework, including TensorFlow, Spark ML, R, and scikit-learn. Seldon can run on top of
          kubernetes and
          Redhat Openshift, MLeap is another way to deply sparkML. Finally TensorFlow can serve any of its model using
          the tensorflow service
          you can deploy even in smartphones, Raspberry PI and also in the web.
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c3-m2-5.PNG" />
          IBM SPSS Collaboration is one tool availabe for this stage in a commercial enviroment.


          <li>Model monitoring and Assesment</li>
          Ensures continous performance quality checks on the deployed models. These checks are for accuracy,
          fairness, and adversarial robustness. Once youÂ´ve deployed a machine learning model, you need to keep track of
          its prediction
          performance as new data arrives in order to mantain outdated models. <br>
          ModelDB, is is a machine model metadatabase where information about the models are stored and can be queried,
          it supports Spark ML pipelines and scikit-learn,
          Prometheus, is a generic and multi-purpose tool used for machine learning model monitoring, although is not
          mainly created for this purpose.
          IBM Fairness 360, is a tool that detects and mitigates against bias in machine learning model. Machine
          learning models are susceptible to suffered
          attacks, the IBM Adversarial Toolbox can be used to detect vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks and help
          make the model more robust.
          Finally IBM AI Explainability 360 is a toolkit that makes the machine learning process more understandable by
          finding similar examples
          with a dataset that can be represented to a user for manual comparison. It can also illustrate training for a
          simple machine learning model
          by explaining how the differents inputs variables affect the final decision.
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c3-m2-6.PNG" />
          <li>Code Asset management</li>
          Uses versioning and other collaborative features to facilitate teamwork. Also referred to as version
          management or version control,
          GIT is now the standard, multiple services have emerged to support git like Github, GitLab, and BitBucket.
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c3-m2-7.PNG" />

          <li>Data Asset Management </li>
          Also supports replication, backup, and access right management. Data has to be versioned and annotated with
          metadata.
          Apache Atlas, is a tool that support this task, ODPI Egeria, is managed through the Linux Foundations and is a
          open ecosystem, and Kylo.
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c3-m2-8.PNG" />


          <li>Development Enviroments</li>
          Tools that help the data scientist to implement, execute, test, and deploy their work. <br>
          Jupyter is the most widely used IDE to work with data Science, it first emerged as a tool of interactive
          python programming,
          it nows supports more than a hundred differents programming languages trough kernels, A key property of
          Jupyter Notebooks is
          the ability to unify documentation, code, output from the code, shell commands, and visualizations into a
          single document. Jupyter Lab
          is the next generation of Jupyter Notebook and in the long term it would be replaced.
          <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c3-m2-9.PNG" />

          <li>Execution Enviroment</li>
          Tools where data processing, model training, and deployment take place. Sometimes your data does not fit into
          a single computer storage
          or main memory capacity. ThatÂ´s where cluster execution enviroments come in. <br>
          The well known cluster-computing framework Apache Spark is among the most active Apache projects and is used
          across all industries,
          including in many Fortune 500 companies. The Key property of Spark is the linear scalability. <br>
          Apache Spark is a batch data process engine, capable of processing huge amounts of data file by file. Apache
          Flink is a stream
          processing image, with is main focus on processing real-time data streams.

        <h4>Application Programming Interfaces (API) </h4>
        <p>
          An API lets two pieces of software talk to each other. You use the API to communicate with the other software components. 
          You dont have to know how the API works, you just need to know there are inputs and outputs. 
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c3-m3-1.PNG" />
        <li>REST API</li>
        <p>
          They enable you to communicate using the internet, taking advantage of storage, greater data access, artificial intelligence 
          algorithms, and many other resources. <br>
          <i>Re</i>presentational  <i>S</i>tate <i>T</i>ransfer API. The API communicates with a web service that you call through 
          the internet.
        </p>
        <img class="imgquiz" src="../css/images/coursera/intro-ds-ibm/c3-m3-2.PNG" />
        <p>
          HTTP methods are a way of transmitting data over the internet, We tell the REST APIs what to do by sending a request. 
          The request is usually communicated through an HTTP message. <br>
          The HTTP message usually contains a JSON file, which contains instructions for the operation that we would like the service 
          to perform. 
        </p>
