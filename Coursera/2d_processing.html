                  <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <h4>Introduction to Computer Vision</h4>
                
                <p>
                    We can use OpenCV for a lot of task for example:
                    <li>Detection and Classification</li>
                    <li>Motion Analysis</li>
                    <li>Scene Reconstruction</li>
                    <li>Image restoration</li>
                    Some librarys to use with opencv are Numpy, dlib, python-pillow, scipy. <br>
                    Some Specific libraries like: Pytorch, tensorflow, Caffe, Point cloud library, Tesseract, OpenNI, etc.
                    <br>
                    We have several modules in OpenCV like core, imgproc, imgcoders, videio, highgui, video, calib3d, features2d, objdetect, dnn, ml, flann , photo, stitching.
                </p>

                <h4>Introduction and digital images</h4>
                <p>
                    <li>Vision: To see is know what is where by looking</li>
                    <li>Computer vision: to design. a computer model vision</li>
                    <li>Turing test for computer Vision:To answer any question regarding an image </li>
                    What and where? we need to idenfity and localize where the objects are.
                    After objects detected we can obtain properties for each objects. We can also 
                    use metric vision to obtaion distance estimation from images. In our human vision we combine 
                    observation and prior knowledge.
                </p>

                <h4>Color Models</h4>
                <img class="imgpost" src="../css/images/coursera/dl-images/w1-1.PNG" />

                <p>
                  What is color? Color is a psychological property of our visual experiences when we look at objects and lights. Is the result 
                  of interaction between physical light in the environment and our visual system. <br>
                  Digital Images are taken using a special technique called Bayer pattern, with this patter we only obtain information for each 
                  pixel and then we stimate missed color values
                </p>
                <img class="imgpost" src="../css/images/coursera/dl-images/w1-2.PNG" />
                <p>
                  Digital color images is three dimensional array where each coordinate is a pixel of the image, where each pixel 
                  x_ij is represented with color vector. <br>
                  Usually each component is discretized to [0,255] and stored in 8 bit word.
                </p>

                <h2>Basic Image Processing </h2>
                <h4>Goals and tasks</h4>
                <img class="imgpost" src="../css/images/coursera/dl-images/w1-4.PNG" />

                <p>
                  When starting working with images there are several tasks and goals we desired to complete in order to suceed 
                  with a project, task related to clean the image, binarize the image etc are some of them.
                </p>
                <h4>Contrast and Brightness Correction</h4>
                <p>
                  There are several reason why our image is low in contrast, we may have low range of sensor sensitivity, or "bad" 
                  sensor transmission function. <br>
                  To start working with contrast we usually used Brightness histogram, this histogram is the chart of brightness 
                  distribution along the image. From left to right values from black to white, and in vertical axis, the number of pixel, 
                  absolute or normalized
                </p>
                <img class="imgpost" src="../css/images/coursera/dl-images/w1-5.PNG" />
                <p>
                  The most basic image point operator which can improve contrast on image is Point operators
                </p>
                <img class="imgpost" src="../css/images/coursera/dl-images/w1-6.PNG" />
                <p>
                  Linear correction is a basic tool that help us to improve contrast or brightness in an image. we calculate 
                  max and minimum values and then we can do regression using some parameters.
                </p>
                <img class="imgpost" src="../css/images/coursera/dl-images/w1-7.PNG" />
                <p>
                  One example of using linear correction is showed below, we start with a poorly distributed brightness and after 
                  making linear correction we can see a more destributed values.
                </p>
                <img class="imgpost" src="../css/images/coursera/dl-images/w1-8.PNG" />
                <p>
                  Linear correction always imprive visual perception, this is why always used.
                </p>
                <img class="imgpost" src="../css/images/coursera/dl-images/w1-9.PNG" />
                <p>
                  Linear correction does not work on everytime we used, there will be some cases where we need a more powerful tool 
                  to correct these brightness and contrast.
                </p>
                <img class="imgpost" src="../css/images/coursera/dl-images/w1-10.PNG" />
                <p>
                  These tool is called non-linear correction, so we define some parameters and stuff to make this algorithm work.
                </p>
                <img class="imgpost" src="../css/images/coursera/dl-images/w1-11.PNG" />
                <p>
                  Free-form brightness transformation is another task we can develop using vs.
